Prime number and Not a prime number 

Program Explanation:

* User must enter the number to be checked and store it in a different variable.
* The count variable is first initialized to 0.
* The for loop ranges from 1 of the number.
* The if statement then checks for the modules of the number if the remainder is equal to 0.
* The count variable counts the number of modules and if the count is equal to 2, the number is a prime number.
* If the count is not equal 2, the number is nâ€™t a prime number.
* The final result is printed.
